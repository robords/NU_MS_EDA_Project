It is a popular site for people to look up inforamation about ratings, cast, directors, reviews, plot, and any other related information about the content. The 4 datasets we chose to use from their database are the Titles basics, the Ratings data, the crew data, and the name basics. The Titles basics has the name of the media, when and how long it was released or aired, run time, and the genres it belongs to. The Ratings data provides the popularity rating and number of votes of the media title. The crew data provides the IDs for directors and writers. Lastly, the Name basics provides the person's name and primary professions. More information about the data sets can be found here: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/. The specific data sets for download are found here: https://datasets.imdbws.com/."
