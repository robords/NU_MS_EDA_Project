    "\n",
    "Our source of data is from IMDb (International Movie Database) which is an online database and website for information about movies, television shows, and other streaming content. It is a popular site for people to look up inforamation about ratings, cast, directors, reviews, plot, and any other related information about the content. The 4 datasets we chose to use from their database are the Titles basics, the Ratings data, the crew data, and the name basics. The Titles basics has the name of the media, when and how long it was released or aired, run time, and the genres it belongs to. The Ratings data provides the popularity rating and number of votes of the media title. The crew data provides the IDs for directors and writers. Lastly, the Name basics provides the person's name and primary professions. More information about the data sets can be found here: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/. The specific data sets for download are found here: https://datasets.imdbws.com/."

    "\n",
    "Understanding data is a key characteristic to starting statistical analysis. Starting off, our team discussed interests and experiences we might have in common, ultimately agreeing with true crime media. This led us to the IMDb dataset, which we could easily understand given our backgrounds and previous use of the site. Furthermore, we were able to come up with unique questions related to True Crime that we want answered through the analysis of our dataset. While there are analytical reports of IMDb data online, we did not find any analysis related to the questions we came up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of this database, the most relevant datasets that we believe could be useful to answer our questions were title.basics, title.ratings, name.basics and title.crew. There are many other databases such as Rotten Tomatoes or Yahoo! Movies, but IMBD allows us to easily read their tsv data files through the pandas library. This is a simple file format to manipulate and extract to dive deep into coding."

    "\n",
    "We want to understand what drives the popularity of True Crime media, and media in general over time.  Specifically, we would like to be able to prove or disprove some of the following questions by the end of this project:\n",
    "  * Is it true that True Crime has become more popular over the past five years? \n",
    "  * Has there been an increase in the popularity of documentaries in general?\n",
    "  * Has there been an increase in the volume of documentaries in general?\n",
    "  * Is there a correlation between the air date of a True Crime TV show or movie and it's popularity? \n",
    "  * Are there correlations between the popularity of a genre, specifically True Crime, and the crew?\n",
    "  \n",
    "Given these questions, we'll need to import data from IMDb for the title of the production itself, the crew, the names of the crew and the ratings for that production.  We'll need to download the data, clean it (there are many nulls represented by \"/N\") and join it in order to proceed with answering the above questions."
