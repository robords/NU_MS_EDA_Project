Starting off, our team collaborated with some interests and experiences that we were all in common with, ultimately agreeing with true crime media. This allowed us to pick out a dataset that we can easily understand each of the attributes. Furthermore, we were able to come up with uncommon and distinct questions/goals that we want answered through the analysis of our dataset. \n",

We chose these datasets because they contain data that will help answer our hypothesis/questions. There are many other databases such as Rotten Tomatoes, Yahoo! Movies, etc, but IMBD allows us to easily read their tsv data files through the pandas library. This is a simple file format to manipulate and extract as well when dwelling deep into coding. \n"
