Starting off, our team collaborated with some interests and experiences that we were all in common with, ultimately agreeing with true crime media.

We chose these datasets because they contain data that will help answer our hypothesis/questions. There are many other databases such as Rotten Tomatoes, Yahoo! Movies, etc, but IMBD allows us to easily read their tsv data files through the pandas library. This is a simple file format to manipulate and extract as well when dwelling deep into coding. \n"
